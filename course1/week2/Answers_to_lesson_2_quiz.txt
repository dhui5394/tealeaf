Name what each of the below is

@a = 2
# @a is an instance variable of a class where 2 is a fixnum

user = User.new
# user is an object, specifically an instance of the class User

user.name
# this is a getter method of the instance "user" for the instance variable "name"

user.name = "Joe"

In Ruby, what's the difference between subclassing and mixing in modules?
#Scope is different; Mix-ins are the same level as the class that includes them whereas subclasses inherit properties of the super class

Given that I can instantiate a user like this: User.new('Bob'), what would the initialize method look like for the User class?
def initialize(n)
  @name = n
end

Can you call instance methods of the same class from other instance methods in that class?
#yes

When you get stuck, what's the process you use to try to trap the error?
# Ideally binding.pry, but I haven't practiced that enough yet to use it well.
