1 Create a local variable and modify it at an inner scope (in between a do/end block). You can try

b) call a method that doesnâ€™t mutate the caller
c) call a method that mutates the caller.
2 Create a local variable at an inner scope (within a do/end block) and try to reference it in the outer scope. What happens when you have nested do/end blocks?
